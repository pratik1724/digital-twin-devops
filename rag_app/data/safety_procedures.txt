SMR Safety Procedures and Operating Guidelines

1. General Safety Requirements

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
- Fire-resistant clothing required in all process areas
- Safety glasses and hard hats mandatory
- Gas detectors for hydrogen leak detection
- Emergency breathing apparatus readily available
- Heat-resistant gloves for high-temperature work

2. Startup Procedures

Pre-startup Safety Checks:
1. Verify all emergency shutdown systems are functional
2. Check nitrogen purge system availability
3. Confirm fire protection systems are operational
4. Test gas detection systems and alarms
5. Verify communication systems are working

Startup Sequence:
1. Begin with nitrogen purge of all process lines
2. Gradually introduce steam flow while maintaining purge
3. Light furnace pilots and establish stable combustion
4. Slowly introduce methane feed at 10% of normal rate
5. Monitor all temperature and pressure indicators
6. Increase feed rates gradually to design conditions
7. Monitor H2_Inlet_Flowrate_Process_variable closely during ramp-up

Critical Parameters During Startup:
- Maximum temperature ramp rate: 50°C per hour
- Pressure increase rate: Maximum 2 bar per hour
- Flow rate increases: No more than 20% per hour

3. Normal Operation Safety

Continuous Monitoring Requirements:
- H2_Inlet_Flowrate_Set_variable vs Process_variable deviation <5%
- Reactor temperature uniformity within design limits
- System pressure maintained within operating range
- Combustion air flow adequate for stable flame

Daily Safety Inspections:
- Visual inspection of all process equipment for leaks
- Check flame pattern in furnace through observation ports
- Verify emergency shutdown system functionality
- Test gas detection system response
- Review alarm logs and address any issues

4. Emergency Procedures

Hydrogen Leak Response:
1. Activate emergency alarm immediately
2. Eliminate all ignition sources in the area
3. If safe to do so, isolate the leak source
4. Evacuate personnel from immediate area
5. Use water spray to disperse hydrogen accumulation
6. Do not re-enter area until hydrogen concentration <1% LEL

Fire Emergency:
1. Activate fire alarm and emergency shutdown
2. Implement nitrogen purge of all process lines
3. Shut off all hydrocarbon feeds immediately
4. Cool surrounding equipment with water spray
5. Do not attempt to extinguish gas fires until feed is stopped
6. Evacuate non-essential personnel

Process Upset Conditions:
- High temperature alarm: Reduce firing rate immediately
- Low flow alarm: Check for blockages or pump issues
- High pressure alarm: Open pressure relief if necessary
- Loss of control air: Activate emergency nitrogen system

5. Shutdown Procedures

Normal Shutdown:
1. Gradually reduce feed rates over 2-hour period
2. Maintain steam flow during cool-down
3. Reduce furnace firing to minimum stable rate
4. Continue operation until reactor temperature <400°C
5. Introduce nitrogen purge while maintaining steam
6. Shut off methane feed when temperature <300°C
7. Continue nitrogen purge for minimum 24 hours

Emergency Shutdown:
1. Immediately close all hydrocarbon feed valves
2. Activate nitrogen purge system
3. Reduce furnace firing to pilot flames only
4. Open pressure relief valves if pressure exceeds limits
5. Continue nitrogen purge until cool-down complete
6. Do not restart without thorough safety inspection

6. Maintenance Safety

Hot Work Procedures:
- Obtain hot work permit before any welding or cutting
- Test atmosphere for combustible gases before work
- Maintain fire watch during and after hot work
- Have appropriate fire suppression equipment available

Confined Space Entry:
- Test atmosphere before entry (oxygen, toxics, combustibles)
- Maintain continuous air monitoring during work
- Use proper ventilation and respiratory protection
- Implement lockout/tagout procedures

Catalyst Handling:
- Use appropriate respiratory protection
- Avoid skin contact with catalyst materials
- Properly dispose of spent catalyst
- Follow manufacturer's safety data sheets

7. Environmental Safety

Emissions Control:
- Monitor stack emissions for compliance
- Report any unusual emissions immediately
- Maintain emission control equipment properly
- Follow air permit requirements

Waste Management:
- Properly classify and dispose of process wastes
- Segregate hazardous and non-hazardous materials
- Maintain waste manifests and records
- Follow environmental regulations

8. Training Requirements

Operator Certification:
- Complete SMR process training program
- Pass written and practical examinations
- Maintain annual recertification
- Attend monthly safety meetings

Emergency Response Training:
- Annual emergency drill participation
- First aid and CPR certification
- Hazmat response training for key personnel
- Self-contained breathing apparatus qualification

9. Documentation and Reporting

Safety Records:
- Maintain daily operation logs
- Document all safety incidents and near misses
- Keep training records current
- Record all maintenance activities

Incident Reporting:
- Report all injuries immediately
- Document equipment failures and root causes
- Submit regulatory reports as required
- Communicate lessons learned to other shifts

10. Key Safety Performance Indicators

Monitor and track:
- Days since last recordable incident
- Number of safety observations per month
- Emergency drill response times
- Gas detection system availability
- Safety training completion rates

Regular review of these indicators helps identify trends and improvement opportunities for maintaining a safe SMR operation.
