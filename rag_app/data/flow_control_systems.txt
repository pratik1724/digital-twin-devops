SMR Flow Control Systems and Instrumentation

1. Inlet Flow Control Systems

H2 Inlet Flowrate Control:
- Primary control loop manages hydrogen feed flow
- Set variable (H2_Inlet_Flowrate_Set_variable): Operator-defined target in ml/min
- Process variable (H2_Inlet_Flowrate_Process_variable): Real-time measured flow
- Typical ranges: 900-1400 ml/min for normal operation
- Control valve response time: 2-5 seconds
- Measurement accuracy: ±2% of full scale

CH4 (Methane) Inlet Control:
- CH4_Inlet_Flowrate_Set_variable: Target methane flow rate
- CH4_Inlet_Flowrate_Process_variable: Actual measured flow
- Operating range: 1000-1800 ml/min depending on production demand
- Steam-to-carbon ratio maintained at 2.5-3.5:1

CO2 Inlet Flow (for some configurations):
- CO2_Inlet_Flowrate_Set_variable: Carbon dioxide injection rate
- CO2_Inlet_Flowrate_Process_variable: Measured CO2 flow
- Used for process optimization and carbon management

N2 (Nitrogen) Purge System:
- N_Inlet_Flowrate_Set_variable: Nitrogen purge flow setpoint
- N_Inlet_Flowrate_Process_variable: Actual nitrogen flow
- Used for startup, shutdown, and emergency purging
- Typical range: 500-1200 ml/min during purge operations

Air Inlet (for combustion):
- Air_Inlet_Flowrate_Set_variable: Combustion air setpoint
- Air_Inlet_Flowrate_Process_variable: Measured air flow
- Controls furnace combustion for reactor heating

2. Temperature Control Systems

Preheater Systems:
- Preheater_Temp_Set_variable: Target preheating temperature
- Preheater_Temp_Process_variable: Actual measured temperature
- Typical setpoint: 450-550°C
- Critical for reaction initiation and efficiency

Reactor Zone Control:
- Multiple temperature zones (typically 3-5 zones)
- Each zone has independent temperature control
- Zone temperatures range from 850-950°C
- Radial temperature uniformity within ±20°C

3. Pressure Management

System Pressure Control:
- Operating pressure maintained at 15-30 bar
- Pressure sensors at multiple locations
- Automatic pressure relief systems
- Control valves regulate system pressure

4. Outlet Flow Monitoring

Product Gas Streams:
- H2O_Outlet_Flowrate: Water vapor and condensate flow
- CO_Outlet_Flowrate: Carbon monoxide in product stream
- H2_Outlet_Flowrate: Primary hydrogen product flow
- N_Outlet_Flowrate: Nitrogen in product stream (from purge)
- CH4_Outlet_Flowrate: Unreacted methane
- CO2_Outlet_Flowrate: Carbon dioxide product
- Air_Outlet_Flowrate: Combustion air exhaust

5. Control Loop Tuning

PID Controller Settings:
- Proportional gain: Adjusted based on process dynamics
- Integral time: Typically 30-120 seconds for flow loops
- Derivative time: Usually 5-15 seconds
- Anti-windup protection enabled for all controllers

Response Characteristics:
- Flow control loops: 95% response in 10-20 seconds
- Temperature loops: 95% response in 2-5 minutes
- Pressure loops: 95% response in 5-15 seconds

6. Alarm and Safety Systems

Critical Alarms:
- High/Low flow rates on all major streams
- High temperature in reactor zones
- High/Low system pressure
- Loss of control air or power

Safety Interlocks:
- Emergency shutdown on critical parameter deviation
- Automatic fuel gas shutoff on flame failure
- Nitrogen purge activation on emergency stop
- Pressure relief valve activation points

7. Calibration and Maintenance

Flow Meters:
- Monthly zero and span checks
- Annual recalibration with certified standards
- Orifice plate inspection every 6 months

Temperature Sensors:
- Quarterly calibration checks
- Thermocouple replacement every 2 years
- RTD validation annually

Pressure Transmitters:
- Semi-annual calibration
- Zero and span verification monthly
- Isolation valve testing quarterly
